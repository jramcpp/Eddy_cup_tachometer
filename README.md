# Eddy_cup_tachometer
The Eddy Cup Tachometer is a non-contact speed measurement device that uses eddy currents to determine rotational speed. It operates by inducing a magnetic field in a rotating conductor, generating a proportional drag force. This design offers high durability, no mechanical wear, and reliable performance in harsh environments.
